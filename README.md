# Data-Modelling
This is one of the course work projects done in pursuit to complete the Masters in Applied Data Science at the UWI Mona. This project is a part of Knowledge Discovery and Data Analytics 1 course. The objective was to use a selected dataset to identify a busines problem and take the data through the various phases of the knowledge and discovery process model. In this case the aim was to predict the probability of churn. To achieve this, four models were generated using logistic regression and decision tree algorithms. For each model, the relevant performance measures were used to determine the best model to achieve the business objectives.
